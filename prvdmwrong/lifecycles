    Implements a "small" amount of lifecycle events for providers.

    We'll admit. We've gotten a bit too lifecycle happy:

    - `:onPostSimulation(dt: number)` runs every `RunService.PostSimulation`
    - `:onPreSimulation(dt: number)` runs every `RunService.PreSimulation`
    - `:onPreRender(dt: number)` runs every `RunService.PreRender`
    - `:onPlayerAdded(player: Player)` runs every `Player.PlayerAdded`
    - `:onPlayerLeaving(player: Player)` runs every `Player.PlayerLeaving`
    - `:onShutdown()` binds to `game:BindToClose` for games and `plugin.Unloading` for plugins
